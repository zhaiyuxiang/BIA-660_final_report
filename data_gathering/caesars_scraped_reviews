NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nOverrated. Service was not satisfactory. At the check in all of the three of our suit cases were delivered to our room dirty and scratched. Place itself looks dingy inside (but, to be honest, so does every other hotel in Vegas, cause they look like they are in need of renovation since the 80-s). Room is ok and looks recently renovated, but the cleaning services were disappointing: housekeeping did not wipe a sticky table, forgot a dirty towel on the top of one of our suite cases, did not provide us with new set of paper cups for coffe after throwing away the old ones. There was alcohol in a mini bar and zero glasses to drink it from. New towels did not feel fresh. The information on booking.com regarding the price of parking was misleading: the booking said that there is a parking that costs 10$ (they did not indicate that 10$ is per 12 hours of parking only). And they did not warn that Caesars charges 23$ per 12 hours of parking.']

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nAfter our first night at the hotel, we discovered our hotel door didn\'t latch fully each time, even though it sounded and looked closed. We woke up that first morning to discover our wallets had been stolen (while we were asleep in the room!) and learned the term "door pusher." The security officer told us we weren\'t the only people to have our rooms broken into that night. The hotel let us change to a bigger room in a different tower, but only comped us for the first night, which was not nearly as valuable as the money we lost, nor made up for the inconvenience of being in Las Vegas for 3 days without access to any money. We also learned the hotel only has cameras in some towers (so avoid Julius tower), and doesn\'t require a keycard to access hotel floors, meaning anyone can lurk around the hotel hallways at anytime.']

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nValet was full and only open to seven star members so had to park in the self park lot and walk through the whole casino to check in. Then we checked in at a electronic kiosk since the line was so long only to be given a room in the tower by the parking garage. So we walked all the way back across the casino with our bags (no one offered to take them), finally get to our room, try to make a cup of coffee and find out it?s $13, for coffee!!!']

POSITIVE REVIEW: ['?\nThe stay was amazing, this is such an important place for Vegas loving people that it really requires no intros. It meets all expectations for 4 stars and it?s thus not cheap, but splurging some bucks on it feels such a guilty pleasure it?s awesome. Stayed in the Forum Tower, in the spirit of democracy.']

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nUpon arrival I asked about reservations for the buffet bacchanal.  I stated that our Anniversary was the next day and asked if we needed reservations.  I was told no reservations were excepted and that it would be a short wait of about 20 minutes.  The next day my husband and I went to the restaurant about 6:00pm.  As we approached a women yells mam you can?t go in there!  I was obviously confused and asked her why not.  She said don?t you see the sign it says restaurant closed.  I then said that we were told that the restaurant would be open as I had spoken to the front desk.  She then said that someone bought out the restaurant for the night and not to go to Nobu either.  Needless to say I was very upset as we were celebrating our 31st anniversary and wanted to eat at that specific restaurant.  Shouldn?t the restaurant have separate rooms for parties so that guests can also enjoy their restaurants?  Shouldn?t Caesars have known that the restaurant was going to be closed prior to the day?  Will not return.']

The little details were missed in the cleaning process. And the shower smelled of mildew. Its the details that count when cleaning a hotel like this. Didn\'t like that you have to pay per device for Wi-Fi. A map of exactly where everything is in the hotel and/or of Las Vegas strip would be nice upon check in. The "map" we were given was not suffice. We were first time Vegas visitors and had a hard time navigating through the hotel/casino. Also this website was not clear what view each room had. I had to Google to see what my room was looking at. FYI The Octavious Tower does not face The Belagio Fountains.']

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nThe first non smoking room we were put in stunk of smoke. We asked to change rooms but of course it was at extra cost. The next room which was identical did not smell of smoke. \nOne half of the room was lit up by floor lamp only. When we tried to turn it on it sparked and crackled. We tried a few times and it still sparked and my husband got a small electrical shock so we unplugged it and kept it off for the 5 nights we were there. It meant total darkness apart from 2 bedside lamps. We mentioned the faulty lamp at the main desk but there was a definite lack of interest in what we told him was dangerous.\nThe room was not cheap, in fact the most expensive on our trip. We stayed at Caesars 5 years ago and this time it felt a lot more worn and tired. \nThe breakfast was also out of our price range. For the 2 of us it was over $100 USD. We had breakfast next casino over.\nHowever Caesars is a great place and I would recommend it. Lovely complex and my favourite position on the strip.']
POSITIVE REVIEW: ['?\nThe room was large and bed was comfortable. The whole Caesars complex is great. \nGreat location on the strip. The view we had was over the pool. The concierge were very helpful and courteous.']

(they add a $10service charge plus gratuity on top of overpriced food).   \nWait off 1 1/2 hours for dinner from  room service.\nI played in the Casino and spent about $1200 without winning a single time.  A little frustrating.  Payback stats are terrrible.\n. No room service menu or information about room or wifi information in the room.   \nNot happy with overall value.']
POSITIVE REVIEW: ["?\nBed was comfortable.  Had to buy overpriced coffee in room for $13, k-cups, not part of stay, which I have never seen before..  It's usually part of the room.   Very nice bathroom.  Nice sofa and table.  okay tv selections.    .  Will stay elsewhere for the price and the long, long walks.  Employees were friendly, especially servers from room service."]

Consequently, don't waste your time and don't buy breakfast during the reservation."]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ["?\nI stated in my reservation that we were a family of 5 and therefore wanted two rooms next to each other.  We booked two rooms in Booking.com as they came offered for a group of 5 - we could not guess from the description of the rooms that they would be located on different towers.  Upon arrival, the staff at the hotel had no clue about the request - even though it was written very clearly. I had expected that someone from the Ceasars or from booking.com would have read it (I booked it over two months in advance, so there was plenty of time for someone to let me know before the trip that the two rooms booked could never be adjacent to each other).  Worse, they told me they couldn't help me fixing the problem because the reservation was through booking.com - ended up into an unpleasant argument with a manager before they finally changed rooms.  \nThis is one of the reasons why using intermediaries like booking , expedia, others becomes frustrating: when there are problems, hotels blame the intermediary and the intermediary blames the hotel."]

Maybe it was our innocence but when you see breakfast included it should mean breakfast is actually included. The price to eat in any of the restaurant\'s is quite dear also. The buffet was 59 dollars per person and even if you went to the fast food burger in the food court it would still set you back 19 dollars for a large burger meal.\nWe requested a non smoking room and to be fair thats what they gave us by putting us on a no smoking floor. But throughout the week we were there, people were constantly smoking in the hallways outside our rooms which kind of cancelled what we had booked. When I phoned reception about this, they did nothing about it.']

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ["?\nJust stay somewhere else honestly. We've tried multiple hotels on the strip and all of them pale in comparison to the Aria, which is a true 5 star. Caesar's palace not only looks tacky/cheesy (which is fine because it is a casino and themed) but everything else was also kind of low class. Being up-sold at the check in desk and feeling pressured to pay more for an upgrade was really uncomfortable, we'd already sprung for a fountain view room - so we weren't in a bad room anyway. We were there for one night and leaving at 6am for Yosemite, being held up at check in and given a hard sell pitch was a waste of time and unnecessary. I could go on, but this hotel isn't worth my time. Just go and stay at the Aria if you're looking for a 5 star experience."]

POSITIVE REVIEW: ['?\nAfter staying at the Cosmo for many years and not being happy with their service we wanted to explore a few new hotels. After a great visit at the Bellagio a few months prior we wanted a similar experience but with a younger feeling pool and we found it with Ceasars. Like the Cosmo there are a number of impressive venues and restaurants inside. We loved the room in the new tower which was very quiet with a great view of the pool. We absolutely loved the pool which included a great swim up Black jack table. Only complaint is the bed which was very soft and hurt my back. The bathrooms were gorgeous and we loved the restaurants and had only one bad experience at the champagne bar Fizz which is a rip off and not impressive. I would recommend the hotel if you have a strong back. I am hoping that one of the other towers may have better beds. Most impressive is the easy check in and check out process with machines and Staff that are ready to help the minute you walk in. Great location as well!']

There are no way of getting around to the rooms without going via the casino which is consistently covered with smoke. Due to the size of the hotel, there are no one to look after you, check in and out via kioks. They suggest you skip housekeeping for a mere $10 off a day. For the price we paid, is seriously not worth the money as the hotel has no ambience at all.']

For example, upon arriving at the hotel, I purchased an upgraded suite for a better experience while in Las Vegas. One of the perks of the upgraded room was the convenience of a personal concierge willing and able to assist wherever necessary. The only problem was, the concierge kept calling and texting my wife (who was at home) asking if she needed anything. My wife kindly informed the concierge to please contact me (her husband) and provided my contact number, the room number etc. yet the concierge person kept texting my wife. Never once was I contacted during my entire stay thus I could not use the additional benefit of the personal concierge. The upgrade was a waste of money. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk staff, they did nothing to correct the issue.']

Lots of waiting until checking in and checking out. Paying for wi-fi even if you said that you don\'t need it, because you have your own mobile acces to internet.']

A beefy security card shouts at you get out of the pool area at 6pm.  Anyone off the street can access any floor of the hotel. No information what so ever in the room about the resort.   And the icing on the cake is Booking.com advertising breakfast in the room rate and then only gives you $10 per person for breakfast!  No complementary tea or coffee in room.  $14 to make your own so much for the $10 breakfast voucher.  Breakfast in the restaurant is $50 plus tax plus tip']

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nMisleading and irrational!\nBreakfast-\n1. Deal says "breakfast included". In practice you get 20$ a day per room for use on some of the hotel\'s restaurants. This was not enough for 2 hot drinks and a snack.\n2. They consider the 20$ to be used on the day before (e.g check in day is first breakfast day, even if you arrive by night), of course we discovered that by checkout.\nRooms-\nWe ordered a king bed room.\nUpon arrival we were told that we got an upgrade.\nGetting to the room we found a 2 queen room. Considered an upgrade because it costs more, but practically as a couple we can use only 1 bed, so this "upgrade" got us from a king bed to a queen bed.\nEventually we got our original room order after 1 night, and a breakfast for the last day.\nHowever, we had to argue with them about it.']

When we went to claim this back, we found out that one of the places we had breakfast wasn't owned by Ceasers and we missed out on our $40 discount. There as a coffee machine by the way... but no coffee... you could use the minibar to get 4 coffee pods for $12 thought... we opted to go buy our own"]

Only $10 per person, max of $20 per room allowed daily for room service food or drinks. On average $25 to $30 is breakfast for one person, so $10 per person doesn\'t do anything. Only two devices allowed on wi-fi otherwise additional charge!  Checking in front desk staff not so friendly. I broke a glass in the bathroom, it took over 2 hours for someone to come and clean the bathroom floor since the glass was all over. When we came back to the room, figured that the floor wasn\'t truly cleaned, just large peaces of glass picked up. There was still a lot of small glass peaces over the floor, so we had to put shoes on when walking in.']

I believe that if you lift the items from the tray, you are charged whether or not you consume them. This is explained in one of the books in the room but it isn't obvious. I understand there is also a charge for the fridge if you use it for your own goods."]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nThe room was extremely disappointing. Very poorly kept and very wore down, furniture was scratch, furniture looked dirty and old. Upon arriving we reported that the blinds and curtains, which are electronic, were not working. They said someone would be up within 20-30 minutes, nothing. Called later that same night around 8, told them no one came up and same thing. Called again at around 12 to tell them that the problem was reported twice and never fixed. Went to bed. At around 6 am, room across us starts getting loud. Some dude kept knocking very hard on the room door across us, he then banged the door and screamed, kicking followed, which woke us up. Again I call to tell them, they tell me they are sending security right away, well this went on another 30 minutes, awake all this time cause the guy does not stop and security never makes it there, called again, get told the same thing. The door banging and kicking and shouting keeps on going till about 7 am and I dont think security ever made it. So did not slept well at all. \n Visit was rather disappointing, I thought that Ceasars Palace would be beautiful and well kept and it was not. I will not stay there again and will not recommend it to any one. I have videos of the screaming guy that I would love to share.']

Rather, the difference had to be paid by the guest upon arrival, defeating the purpose of my purchasing the room for them.  It was lucky they had enough money to cover the remainder which the hotel refused to charge to the same credit card used online.  The hotel staff did not explain this well upon arrival and we thought we were getting double-charged.  It took phone calls to both Bookin.com and Ceasars customer support to find out what was going on as well as multiple tries at the Hotel check-in.  The issue was not fully resolved (as described above.)']

Human poo in lifts and corridors for 24 hours. Book with breakfast but in reality you get $10 credit per person per day and the breakfast buffet costs $50 per person! A Diet Coke will set you back $10 plus tax. Everyone expects a tip! There are several pools and would be lovely if they cleaned it. It's filthy. Loads of shops in the forum shopping centre but again I think the prices have been hiked up. There was a Rolex that in the uk is ?18,000 but there it is nearly $29,000 even with the current exchange rate it still comes out over ?24k. The weather was great and if I ever went back it would be to a different hotel as this one really is the pits! Which is a shame. Oh yeah you don't even get free tea or coffee making facilities in your room. It's $13 for a kit that will give you 4 coffee pods and coffee mate powder. There is tax on top of that too and there is a $39.99 resort fee per day per person too! Won't return to this poor hotel"]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ["?\nThe rooms are quite far from the reception (it takes between 10 and 15 minutes to get to the reception desk from the room) and there is always (regardless of time) a line at the counter. This makes it difficult to solve any problems you may have.\nI had booked a non-smoking room in the premium category.  I got an amazing room with crazy-beautiful views, but that was connected through a door to another room where the guests smoked. My clothes and luggage smelled for days.\nWhen we asked for a solution, we were moved to a room of a lesser category. Although a really nice room, I had paid for another room category. This was not explained to me at the desk, neither was I asked if I wanted to change categories.\nWe had further problems with the self-parking validation (valet parking is around 20 dollars and if you plan to move around Vegas in your car during your stay, this is not a very sustainable option) and had to spend a lot of time coming and going to and from the reception and waiting in line to get our problems solved.\nAll in all, the staff who helped us with our problems were very nice and helpful, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the hotel cares what kind of experience the guests have or about making problems right. \nFor a hotel that claims to be of such category and demands such prices, I would have expected a better guest service."]
POSITIVE REVIEW: ["?\nThe hotel is really a world in its own and it is truly impressive. It has everything you could need in it (all types of shops and restaurants, pool and multiple options for gambling. The location is one of the best in the strip, as it's in the middle of everything"]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nDisappointed that such a highly sort after hotel had so many extra room costs involved. A $25 charge to unlock the mini fridge was excessive and $15 for wifi seemed like just another way to make money. For such a large hotel I felt like everything was very overpriced and perks such as the above should be complimentary which would really help to add to the seemingly "luxuriosness" of the hotel. \nIt was also very easy to get lost in such a large hotel. We found the wayfinding very lacking which made it very hard to find anything in the hotel. When visiting other hotels we didn\'t experience the same confusion when finding our way around. So more signage would be hugely beneficial! \nAlthough we were upgraded to an amazing room we were never told about the renovation works that were happening in the wing we were upgraded too. Had we been told about this in advance we would have asked not to be upgraded as construction was happening in the room right above us, waking us up each morning at 7am. Ideally people would be advised about this before being upgraded.']
POSITIVE REVIEW: ['?\nThe bed was very large and extremely comfy. We were upgraded to a junior suite which had a double shower and a jacuzzi bath which we loved!

POSITIVE REVIEW: ['?\nAmazing from the first time you enter the spectacular lobby. Lots of choices to eat and drink - the Bacchanal Buffet was incredible, not cheap but the food was an incredibly high standard, limitless king crab legs, Chinese, Mexican, American, Italian etc etc. The forum shops were lovely to walk around and included lots of dining options too - we had happy hour at the Trevi restaurant bar a few times, $4 frozen Bellinis between 4-6pm and the Cheesecake Factory was always busy. Free drinks whilst having a flutter on the roulette wheel was great. The hotel is also on a huge plot in the middle of the strip so easy access to everything else especially if you use the Deuce bus, $8 for a 24 hour ticket. You could stay here and not come out for a week though!']

It can really add up quickly.  \nHotel charged $40/night for a "resort fee" on top of the nightly hotel fee.  I would have thought the hotel fee would cover the "resort fee".  I think it\'s just another way to get more money from us.  Resort fee didn\'t allow access to sauna, hot tub or steam room which was depressing.']

POSITIVE REVIEW: ['?\nAt first we given a room in the Palace Tower and it was fantastic.  Beautiful view of the pools.  The bathroom was awesome.  It had two bathrooms.  One side had a toilet and sink and the other had a bathtub, toilet sink and the shower connected the two bathrooms.  The shower had two shower heads so that my husband and I could shower at the same time.  There was a lovely sitting area with a couch and chair.  Very pretty room.  On our 2nd morning, we were woken by construction going on in the room above at 6:00 am.  They were working right above our bed.  It sounded like they were going to come right through the ceiling.  We contacted the Front Desk and they moved us to the Augustus Tower.  We were told that this Tower was completely renovated and the room would be an improvement from what we had.  The room did not have the wonderful bathroom that we had and the view was of the roof tops.  The only thing I liked about the room was that the bed was far more comfortable.  We saw the show Absinthe which is in a Tent on the Caesars property.  Loved it!!  Not a bad seat in the house.  Super nice Staff at Caesars.  We also used the Gym and it was fantastic.  Loved the equipment and the space.']

This is not something I would have minded paying for if the hotel were upfront about the costs - but rather it was something that was brought to my attention at check-in. \nThe facilities e.g. pool etc. were used by everyone from other hotels so I fail to see why people wouldn't stay at cheaper hotel-casinos and just go to Caeser's during the day. \nStaff seemed confused about charges that were mandatory etc. Wifi was very patchy."]

I made the booking with you so you have a responsibility to deal with this, Guest services at the hotel were patronising to say the least, This was meant as a treat but instead I may as well have stayed at home as I am up earlier with sleep disturbed by the construction site. Also be aware of the ?200 deposit that we were not told about, also all three of the pools are dirty with no filtration running and leaves with floating around.

We paid the $13 charge for the inroom coffee (4 cups) however my husband having a sweet tooth used all the sugar in the package for one cup. We requested extra sugar from housekeeping (while leaving a generous tip)  but this never came. In the end we took extra portions from the bellagio buffet - which was also better value."]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ["?\nWe'd been offered a free 'upgrade' to a room in the Palace Tower when checking in. However, there was hammering and construction noise above the room from 7.15am, which we'd not been warned about when checking in. We phoned the house keeper and she said nothing could be done about it. The 'resort fee' was waived but this was a small recompense for the fact we couldn't sleep in due to the noise. Also, there was a 25-minute wait before checking in. Parking was VERY confusing: self-parking wasn't clearly sign-posted (we saw no signs anywhere for it), so we had to use the more expensive valet parking. Also, it's ridiculous that you have to pay for parking on top of the room price when the hotel/casino wouldn't get any visitors without parking! You can't even make a coffee in the room without paying. The restaurants on site are over priced (we went to Rao's, where we found the staff unfriendly and the food wasn't worth the $70 per head price tag.) This place is out to fleece guests for whatever it can."]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nThe check in process was an absolute nightmare. Firstly, with booking.com we bought \'breakfast included\' however when we checked in we were told breakfast is not included. Instead we were given $10 voucher for each morning to spend at very limited outlets owned by Caesars palace. However none of these food outlets had breakfast items for $10 or less. So there was no way to buy breakfast with $10. The actual Ceasaes palace buffet costs $40 per person. We were not offered an apology or any solutions to this problem. In fact, the rude staff member told us "you should sue bookings.com for false advertising". Utterly disappointing. \nSecondly, when checked into our room and the disappointment continued. We were on the lowest floor in the oldest tower. Our window faced a brick wall. The room was old and small. Nothing like our expectations. We called reception to ask for a room change and we\'re told we would have to vacate the room and it could take up to 12 hours for another room to be ready. As it was 5pm this was not an option. Finally after speaking to the manager we were transferred to a slightly better room. \nThirdly, as we paid the overpriced \'resort fee\' we were offered wifi included. At check out we were charged 4X$14 charges for apparently a third device connected. We did not have any other devices except one phone each so this was impossible. After lining up at reception for 20 minutes this was finally replaced back on our card, of course with no apology. \nOverall your Caesars palace and booking.com experience was not only disappointing but heart breaking. I will never be recommending this hotel or website to anyone in the future.']

Just walk straight in. And they did it constantly!\nAlso, if you're considering going to Omnia because of the incredible reviews, make sure you go on a night where the main room is open. Luckily, we asked the concierge how to get on the door list. If we hadn't, we would have forked out over $50 to go to the smaller, bland, nothing overpriced nightclub attached to Omnia.\nAlso also, the people working the retail stores in the hotel (not in the Forum shops) really have their hustle on. Beware. They have a quota to reach."]
POSITIVE REVIEW: ['?\nThe hotel was amazing. The check in staff and concierge were so helpful, even pumping our checkout up from 11am to 2pm. The facilities were great. The room was awesome and the bed was like a cloud. The parking is free. The location is great. We went in winter so the main pool was closed, but we will be back in summer because it looked too good not to!']

Our sink handle was loose and had issues shutting off. The shower door was cracked. The light was burned out - which they replaced for us. No microwave. The fridge in room was useless- they stocked it with over priced alcohol and soda. It automatically charges you if it\'s moved so you can\'t even remove it to put your own water or left overs in it. The pool was closed. The check-in /out lines were incredibly slow. They staffed one person behind the desk and one person to stand by the line to tell you it was your turn. Just put them both behind the darn desk to move things along!!! We were charged 3x for the room so rather than dropping the key cards and going home we had to stand in that long slow line again just to be told they will not process all 3 charges. They just do that "in case" she said. Totally confusing and a waste of time.']

We had to change all our luggages by ourself and to go at the opposite of the hotel. I think for this kind of hotel people should do that for us. Finally, we spent the worst night ever because we had been wake up at 7am because of works in the hotel ! It's totally unexapetable ! The hotel is big and it's not a high season so I think they should close the part of the hotel with the works. We told the hotel for the terrible noise and they really didn't care. So I definitely not recommend this hotel !"]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nThe overwhelming sensation that the strip, an CP in particular are designed to coral you into a space that optimizes their ability to rip you off with excessive charges. In addition the queue at the cashier takes foevere, because CP has a policy of serving their high ranking guests first, no matter the length of the ordinary queue. And the cashier staff operate at a speed which is significantly less than the croupiers at rhe tables...\nFinally, but importantly, the air in the casino is foul.']

We especially loved the courtesy valet.\nRestaurants were top notch - Mr Chow's WOW and Gordon Ramsay's was fabulous.\nIt is central to the strip, so everything was a short walk.\nWe saw Celine Dion whilst there and she blew our mind. The Colosseum where she performed is amazing!\nThe nightclub was also brilliant and is currently featuring Calvin Harris on a Friday night - can't get better than that!\nWe toured all the other casino's whilst there and felt that this was the best for experience and value."]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nWrong room, horrible customer service, and bad memories. First of all, instead of the room with a King bed, we were checked in (by an electronic terminal at the reception area) into a Twin room. Since it was a gift to my significant other for their birthday, I did not want to leave the matter alone. I couldn\'t resolve the issue over the phone, so I had to go downstairs and wait in line for a while. It turned out that there were no more Double rooms left. Even though they admitted that they overbooked the rooms, staff at the reception obviously did not care and did not want to do anything about it. They had rooms of higher category which they could offer as a compliment (it is quite a common practice) since overbooking was not the guests\' problem but theirs. However, it was not the case. They refused to provide at least late check out as a compensation for the inconvenience. There was no menu for the in-room dining; prices that I found on their website were not updated that resulted in a bill a little higher than I expected. The next morning, we checked out over the phone to save time. As soon as I received a copy of my receipt in my email, there was another surprise. We were charged for the entire (I guess entire) minibar which we did not even touch. It was empty, besides one lonely box of cashew nuts, to start with. Instead of saving time, we had to go to the reception and wait in line again. Thankfully, staff at the reception desk, after listening to my complaint and asking a couple additional questions, decided to refund me for the services that I did not use. However, overall look of the person and lack of just a couple simple words like "we are sorry for the inconvenience" completely persuaded me that people who work at this hotel do not know what a good customer service is. At least some of them. We wanted to go to their swimming pool, but we were so fed up with Caesars Palace that we decided to leave.']
POSITIVE REVIEW: ['?\nThe room was neat, not too big but quite comfortable for a couple. Since we went to the Omnia club that night, it was a perfect location. In-room dining food was good.']

Bed hadn't been changed, roll away beds still in there. Took 3 phone calls to front desk and over an hour to get it sorted. Don't know why we weren't immediately moved to another room. Was told I can still go to the pool as it closed at 6, this was not true, pool closed at 5. Paid a lot of money for a lot of nothing."]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nWe came as a group of friends and we called the call center before to ask if we will get a room for 3 people with two queen beds and a rollaway bed. We were informed that this is no problem and will be free of charge if we are booking for 3 people on booking.com. After arrival however the reception desk first refused to put in a rollaway bed into the room claiming it is too small for that (the room turned out to be very larger). Once they finally agreed we were told we need to pay a 30USD fee!!! This is not the service we expected from one of the most expensive hotels in Vegas :(']
POSITIVE REVIEW: ["?\nElegant hotel in the middle of Las Vegas, a top choice for wealthy individuals who don't mind paying millions of additional fees (like 10USD+ for coffee in the room)"]

Customer service from the main Registration Staff was appalling with no sympathy for a problem caused by the Hotel and not the guests. Three rooms booked and only one could be found despite the fact that Ceasars themselves take the first nights room payment in advance.  Accommodation booked 11 months in advance and ended up having to pay and extra $3000 on arrival in order to get accommodation.  Absolutely no way would our family recommend this hotel.  The negative response to any query made the customer feel completely in the wrong. Not at all what we expected to experience on a special celebration stay that the hotel had been notified about in advance. NEVER AGAIN.']

When checking in at counter, the young man said we have a good deal you can go to any of the restaurants on list with a particle symbol, being one meal in day breakfast, lunch or dinner and it would be $20 no more, I was stupid to not question him more. Not knowing it was $20 off what ever our bill was. When checking out I was shocked and furious because this should have been explained better, the girl at desk said Caesars doesn't outright give breakfast deals. This is what you offered on your site and I took it. This young man didn't tell us this. I have been too upset to reply earlier because this hit our budget and have had to compromise for rest of trip. Will never go back to Vegas and I will tell as many people as I can how we were trapped. You representing them should also know they don,t do breakfast as other hotels do. Very disappointed ."]

We (two couple) hit alarm button, called hotel on cell phone, got operator taped menu, selected front desk, got reservations, explained we were stuck on elevator, agent asked what room we were in? "No room, we are stuck in the elevator!  \nThe call was transferred to Maintenance, "stuck on elevator, do something!"  \n  "Which tower?  What is the number of the elevator?"\n  Explained again.  Maintenance did show up.  Doors were not opened but elevator went up to our floor and doors opened there.  What a relief! Got out quickly.  \n  In our room we laid down to relieve some of the strain.  We never mentioned the stress of escaping a possible disaster but we have talked about it since.  Our relaxation was interrupted by the phone.  The manager apologized and offered to buy us dinner.  \n  "Alright, thank you."\nActually he conditioned his offer by giving us a $75 credit for one of the hotel\'s restaurants.  When we ate dinner we found that we still owed $14 on the bill!  I think the manager must be proud of himself -- he saved the hotel a lot of money.']

No one comes to take your order for drinks at the pool.. Waited an hour or more and eventually went up myself and got them , for $500 a night not worth it. Disappointed. Also the hotel overcharged my card when we prepaid a night and a half already on the long weekend which meant I had lost $500 off my card and could not transfer more because the banks were shut. Hotel gave me a $25 voucher to use... For an inconvienance like that, you would think a hotel that high up would be more apologetic and try and cheer up the stay.']

The Forum Tower with rooms ending in **19 have a mirror for Windows in bedroom and a gap in the distance for a window in the lounge!! Like a dungeon.  We went and complained 7.30am after 1st night (12 hour flight the day before) and asked to be put into original booking.  Took until 2.00pm, so wasted day, and two very hot tired customers by the time we got to new Octavius Tower.']

Had a couple of issues and had to join long queue again a couple of times to talk to receptionist.Self check-in system wasn't suitable for first time arrivals who had questions. 'Free' breakfast is not free but a $10 voucher per adult per day. Breakfast is likely to cost $80-$100 for family of four so this is a poor representation. All meals and drinks very expensive but in fairness it is a top hotel so maybe expected. Our room had a view of a wall even though we paid for an upgraded room via booking.com. Suspect standard room couldn't have been any worse."]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nAfter my husbands luggage was lost at the airport we travelled to Caesar\'s by taxi and would wait for the airline to reunite us with our luggage at the hotel at some point.\nWhen we got to the hotel we used the quick check in kiosk which couldn\'t find our reservation. The kind attendant called our reservation in and they could not find our reservation. I had our confirmation from online with me. A room was found. Instead of a double queen bedroom we were given a single bedroom. We went back downstairs to get the right room.\nAlthough we hopped the line to get to the desk we were told there were no more double rooms. Would we like a room with an "adapted shower with no step and low closet"! What? A handicapped room with a double bed. By now it\'s 11:30 and we are tired so we say yes.\nThe room was bigger but the bathroom was kind of sub standard with a shower curtain and fold down bench in the shower. Didn\'t think too much of it until we took showers in the morning. The water drained out of the shower into the middle of the bathroom to a drain in the floor. It was like a lake! We soaked it up the best we could and tried not to get too upset. I mean handicapped people use this. I can use it.\nThe next day getting ready for a wedding the amount of water was just ridiculous! In fact how could someone in a wheelchair get around it without running through it spreading the water around and possibly getting electrocuted if you tried to use the hair dryer in there!! Let alone the amount of towels needed to soak up - not dry - the floor.\nWe asked for more towels because we had used them all. When they were brought to us they didn\'t ask for the used towels. When we asked to comp our extended late departure the hotel said we should have complained earlier. They paid our resort fee of $35.\nI guess Caesar\'s can stand to hold their ground because they are a big corporate machine. But handicapped people beware...']

The resort fee you pay only covers Internet for 2 devices, if you want to connect 2 phones and a laptop you have to pay. In general, they simply try to squeeze more money out of you."]

We stayed in the Petite King Suite. It has 2 bathrooms which is a major bonus for us. This tower is older, but still has some  updates and is nice. I would choose this suite again, because you get much more room for your money than you do in their newer towers.']

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ["?\nHow I couldn't check in at the kiosk.. Had to wait at least 15-20\nmins in line.the lady at the front desk said she will let us know when\nthe room is ready.. . Was a few hours early so dropped our things at the\nbell desk and went out.. When we came back approx 330 .. 4pm was check\nin, received no message or call at all until we got sick of waiting and\nwent to the kiosk again.. Still couldn't read my passport or credit\ncard- Anthony sent me to the premium line because he didn't want to\nhave me wait.. Still a 15 minute wait .. It was about 5 pm this time ..\nFinally got to the counter and I said to the lady will I have to wait in\nline tomorrow when I check out ?? She said not at all... Ok I said and\noff to our room we went - wifi is absolutely terrible I can't\nbelieve I pay resort fees.. For this crap! Wifi was dropping in and out\nand couldn't contact family I was meeting up with- they waited for\nover an hour for us and ended up leaving! Great start to the night. The\nnext morning guess what?? Kiosk didn't work again. Pain. Had to wait\nin line for 20 minutes .. We got there early just incase but it was\nabsolutely terrible .. Check in and check out are a pain and why pay\nresort fees when the wifi doesn't even work!! The shops have better\nwifi then that.. And travelling all the way from Australia I am\ndisappointed. Will definitely be staying elsewhere next time"]

On my booking it has been mention breakfast included but it wasnt and the staff didnt wanna listen to it. I had to pay the price of one night to have my room earlier and by earlier i mean 11am whereas i did the check in at 8am whereas in the luxor hotel we did the check in at 9 am and got the room without paying more! There is no shadow at the pool, which is verry dangerous for the health. All staff is begging for big tips but do nothing to deserve it! The room was good cause it looked like new but we weren't in a tower or the main building and disnt have any view. That was so disapoited!"]

The self-check-in kiosks were out of order, there were only 3 clerks at the check-in desk to accommodate all the arrivals.  You would think management would anticipate a large number of guests to arrive on a FRIDAY (it is Vegas after all) and either have the kiosks working or place more clerks to check-in arrivals.  It took more than 40 min to check-in.']

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nWe had informed the hotel that we would be arriving at around 10 am and to ask for the possibility of an early check-in. The reply was they would try. When we got there we were told to pay an extra $30/ if we wanted that which should have been communicated to us in the first place. We were only allowed to check -in at 4 and check out was at 11.We have traveled to many hotels and most were accommodating enough to try and give us at least 1 room early so that we could rest. For a property that is so large it was disappointing that their only concern was dollars.\nAlso, after the first day we were having difficulty with the $20/ per day per room voucher. Think Caesar should just give the vouchers to the guests for them to redeem and not have guests running up and down to reception to get them to call the outlets.\nHotel was also too cold and the outside was too hot for us. So overall it was rather disappointing']

They told me if you want to charge the card on file and I actually had I changed to a different card and they charged that one instead and supposedly refunded my money to my other card but I still haven't seen a refund yet. I was first told it would be refund that same day, then I was told oh no it takes two business days, and at check out I asked again and I was told oh no it take up to 5 days for a refund to go thru. Needless to say still haven't gotten my refund."]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nAn excellent hotel but perhaps you don\'t need to pay only for the air you breathe. Example: Wi-Fi is free only in the room. The moment you walk into the hotel you are charged a hefty daily "roaming" fee. Don\'t move any bottles as this triggeres a sensor which bills you immediately']

We were awoken at 4am with a rowdy party of guests in the adjoining room shouting swearing etc with most of them we later found out not even guests of the Hotel. They even tried to get in to our room thru the connecting door frightening my wife and I . Security didn't help and eventually at 6.30am the noise stopped but by then we had had enough and checked out. The hotel whilst making the right noises did not address the issue. So be warned ! Stay at the Bellagio as they have security on the lifts leading to the rooms and won't let you access the room areas without a keycard ! This doesn't happen there ! "]

You cannot get a breakfast from that, given that the buffet is 39$, the cheapest sandwich in a cafe is 15$.\n- The pool closed at 6pm.\n- The 2 waters on the desk is also deceptive. Hotels usually give 2 bottles of water gratis per night. There were additional ones _in_ the minibar, that is obviously extra charge. So we drank them, and were charged 7$ each (minibar price).\n- Terrible long waiting line for check in and check out. Kiosk machines won\'t accept passports outside the US']

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ["?\nCaesars has changed and not for the better. I visit Las Vegas regularly, both on business and fun. I have stayed at many hotels, Aria, Bellagio, Caesars, Mirage, MGM. The Best Hotel so far has been the Aria. Ceasers must be suffering financial concerns at the moment as everything has a charge now, Costs $25 to open the fridge (not use anything, just to open it). water in your room is $7... same bottle at the 7-11 is $1...Wifi is not free, ask for glasses to your room and there's a $10 charge.. 2 pints will cost you over $20 (US pint too...). Buffet Breakfast was $78 ! Also, it was interesting to see that no one we saw was winning at the tables, roulette, blackjack, craps, etc.  A few months back when I was there, people were winning, I saw 1000's of dollars at one table alone be lost in the space of a few mins (not out the ordinary for vegas) but it was mostly in Caesars. Even the play patterns looked odd.. same numbers coming up, ratios to black and red, dealers very regularly getting blackjack. I know it does vary anyway and I'm not a huge gambler, just basing this on past recent experiences in LV and it was different in Bellagio and Aria and Planet Hollywood.... I wouldn't stay at Caesars again, there are better hotels there now for better money, Caesars plays too much on its name rather than the quality of service it used to have. My 6 other friends had similar, if not worse issues (sick not cleared up in the room(previous guests), no hot water..). Shame to see such an iconic LV establishment loose its sheen..."]

I feel the daily resort fee should probably offset some of the resort costs..... drinks should be cheaper so you have more money left to make bad decisions after many of them (is how vegas USED to be). So not impressed with the gouging..... sneak in booze!!!!']

As they are entering your room they are saying housekeeping.. A little too late!! Was charged twice for my late check out fee after explaining the bill and looking at my account to the attendant at the counter. Had to ask the housekeeper to change the linens due to stains. Had stayed there for 4 days 4 nights.. Things happen. Smoke ventilation in hotel is not great compared to the other hotels in the close surrounding areas. I just wasn't happy with the stay of this hotel. More money for the glitz but not worth it. Had a friendlier atmosphere at close surrounding hotels.. If I could get my money back I would. No the room didn't have a view.. You have to pay extra for that"]

I said well....I will be here another 30 minutes can you speak with management about charges for 30 minutes.\nThe response I received was "we do not do part day rentals", I proceeded to say, so....I spend thousands of dollars in this hotel exclusively and I now am required to sit pool side on concrete.  I don\'t get it!\nI then said would it be possible for me to pull up a lounger to visit with my friends in the pool, Response was.."I am sorry, loungers can not be pool side".   So I will share this story, it doesn\'t seem right, I was a guest spending quite a bit of money and was treated as someone off the street.  So I ask.....What is the point of staying at Ceasars?\nI was at the Wynn during March Madness, seating was a non issue, drinks and service was top shelf.   Additionally, the night we were playing tables, I was asked by a friend to sit with him as he was playing, he stood and gave me his seat.  Then the floor manager proceeded to come over and asked me to get up if I was not playing, so I stood only to be told to sit back down by the man who asked me to sit with him and call his numbers for him.  He then spoke loudly at the floor manager and said, "you are very rude, you never ask a lady to stand, I am playing she is sitting in my seat"....it proceeded to get heated a bit more and another guest, name being Tony, approached the floor manger and said why don\'t you have someone come take a drink order please, the manager listened and said yes sir.  Tony is a big IT guy that spends much time and money there, at least that is what I was told.  Then...']

The last time we stayed there, there were these awesome robes (one of the reasons I went back). This time, with no explanation other than "we stopped doing that", they were not in our room. Not too enough perks for staying in one of the most expensive places on the strip. Kind of disappointing.']

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ['?\nFelt like the "extras" that are usually in a hotel room were missing here. Specifically, we had no bath robes in our rooms, no bags for laundry, no coffee pods with the keurig (the kit was $25 to buy, I haven\'t been to a hotel room in a long time that didn\'t have a few complimentary coffees and teas). We were also charged $30 for early check in, which was fine but both times we\'ve been to Vegas before (at planet Hollywood and the Bellagio) it was given as a courtesy.']
POSITIVE REVIEW: ["?\nCheck in process was automated and quick, the room was clean and noise was minimal. The location can't be beat, and parking was free."]

Main pool area was dirty, fag ends and rubbish inbetween tightly packed sun beds. Booked as room with breakfast was a con $10 for 2, can't get anything for that price. On check out we were billed for 3 item at $14 from mini bar but didn't have. They did rectify this. Very smokey everywhere you went in hotel."]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ["?\nPoor ventilation and too much cigarette smoke is my only negative comment about an otherwise fabulous casino.  In 2016 there is absolutely no logical reason to allow cigarette smoking inside the facility. Designated smoking areas OUTSIDE could be provided and smokers can also vape inside. Put the health and comfort of your employees and guests (non-smokers and smokers) first and move into the 21st century! Smokers WILL NOT stop coming to your casino if they cannot smoke inside. They will follow the no smoking rules like they do everywhere else. Ceasar's has some of the best restaurants on the strip, but nothing is more disappointing than to treat yourself to an excellent and expensive meal at The Palms and have someone sit down at the table beside you and smoke the entire meal. Ruined our dinner and made the tab much harder to justify."]

NEGATIVE REVIEW: ["?\nI didn't like that my room did not have a view outside the window when I specifically asked for one. The pre check in kiosk were not working properly at the time when I arrived even though I had followed directions when an email was sent to preregister  hours before I had arrived to the hotel. After finally checking in and getting my room keys and walking all the way to the room with my luggage  to find the keys didn't work was such a disappointment and inconveniently I had to go all the way back to the check in counter with my luggage after a long day of traveling from the east coast to get another set of room keys and start the check in process over again. Staff did not seem emphatic of of me having to check in today. Not even a small perk was given despite their mistake.\nItems are very overpriced. There is not even complimentary bottled water in the room despite the high cost of the room. Everything has a fee and fees were ridiculously high in prices. No vending machines were available next to the ice machine on my floor."]
POSITIVE REVIEW: ['?\nThe location of the hotel was right in the middle of the strip. I stayed in the renovated rooms of Julius Towers and the room and bathroom looked luxurious. The bed was comfortable and the shower head pressure was perfect. The room was spacious and housekeeping did a wonderful job in keeping the room clean everyday throughout my stay. The hotel has many amenities and has shops, restaurants and clubs that people can enjoy. I liked the food court in the shopping area. The decor, statues, and design of the hotel is very nice. This hotel definitely is not a basic, regular and standard hotel but has more of a resort,high class feel to it.']
